AGAIN?\" Or perhaps you're enjoying the comedic works of Fred Armisen, when you notice Maya Rudolph and Andy Samberg keep popping up.

    "To begin, lets take a look at the overlap between (non-SNL-related) projects. I began by analyzing the crossover between IMDb 'knownForTitles,' the set of four or five titles on the cover page of an actor's IMDb page. I created the following graphic by doing just that. I first ensured that for every entry of an SNL actor's name in the IMDb dataset, I was appending the knownForTitles to a larger list of titles for that actor and also a complete list of knownForTitles for all the actors. That process involved creating a boolean table which checked for each title against an actor's knownForTitles list."

Each table is then called to create a binary heat map based on a call from the bqplot barchart bar selection. The final dashboard is displayed at the end of the article.\n",

    "I wanted to create more accurate comprehensive lists of projects that each cast member has been involved in. I did this through a process called web scraping. I scraped wikipedia 'Filmography' tables for each SNL cast member. The table in the [List of Saturday Night Live cast members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_cast_members) Wikipedia page became a perfect hub of the SNL players' Wikipedia hyperlinks. I used those links and the Filmography tables on each page to build the lists of each actor's tv and film projects.  \n",
