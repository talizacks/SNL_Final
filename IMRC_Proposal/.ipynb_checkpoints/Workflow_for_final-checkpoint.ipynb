    "I would say that most of my pain points come from having never attempted a project like this before. Both the final assignment for my Data Viz class and this final are almost entirely open ended. I have never had to work with data from so many different sources to get what I am looking for and frankly, I'm kind of embarrassed by the amount of help I've been asking for. It feels like everytime I hit a wall, my instinct is to just ask someone else a ton of questions. I need to learn how to come up with solutions in my own creative way rather than just feeling stuck and immediately seeking help.\n",

    "## Activity Reflection\n",
    "This activity was helpful for many reasons, but mostly because I'm the kind of person who doesn't let due dates control my schedule (even when I should). Being able to look at the steps of my project written out on paper in order to physically see the components of each step was incredibly productive. Regularly, I work by going with the flow and conceptualizing in my head. In conjunction with the due date portion or the assignment, I was able to get a pretty solid idea of the kind of work I will have to do moving forward and the timeline that I should be working on. I'm not used to breaking up assignments in this way. I'm not sure if I will adopt it into my regular workflow, but I definitely feel more at ease now that I have. It felt like the equivalent of an outline for a writing assignment and that did give me some comfort. I also began to realize that while I already feel behind on my project, that is merely in my head and if anything, I am ahead of schedule."
